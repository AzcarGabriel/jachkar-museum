      <ImportantFeatures>The main cross has two wings with two triple- loops. The middle loops are stretched and have a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. The palm decor originates from the cross and transforms into snakes that symbolize the defense of the garden-paradise (paradise-tree). The right and the left parts of the khachkars represent various geometric and vegetative ornaments. Two pomegranates that originate from the upper part of the cross stimulate the Christian allegory of fruits: under the sour rind, there are sweet seeds (Petrosyan, H.2008). Rosette is crowned with a ribbon-like border - resembling a shield or a tray. The cornice represents interlaced geometric ornaments.</ImportantFeatures>
