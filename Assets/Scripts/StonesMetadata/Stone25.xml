      <ImportantFeatures>Khachkar is in bad condition, and if we look on the bottom line of the main cross, we can assure that the two wings of the cross had two triple- loops. Rosette has a form of a flower, which has various palm decorations inside. There are also palm leaves originating from the bottom part of the rosette. The right and the left sides have various geometric ornaments.
