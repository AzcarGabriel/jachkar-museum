      <ImportantFeatures>Khachkar is partially covered with mold and moss and it’s difficult to identify various details and ornaments. The cross is carved in a niche, and the two wings have two triple- loops. The middle loop is stretched and has a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. The two little crosses on the right and the left parts of the central cross, symbolize the two bandits crucified with the Christ.  The niche represents the ritualistic character of the cross to the believer (e.g. worshiping) and symbolizes the terrestrial sphere, and the abstract-universal measure of the cross (Petrosyan, H. 2008).  Although it’s difficult to identify the details, it can be seen that the palm décor is depicted as originating from the cross and such a perception corresponds to the Christian notions of the cross as an all bearing tree (Petrosyan, H. 2008). The cornice of the khachkar and the right and the left parts represent various geometrical and vegetative ornaments.
