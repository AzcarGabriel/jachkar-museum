      <ImportantFeatures>The cross has two wings that have two triple- loops and the middle loops are stretched and have a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. The right and the left parts of the khachkar represent interlaced geometric ornaments. The two little crosses on the right and the left parts of the central cross, symbolize the two bandits crucified with the Christ. Palm decor is depicted as originating from the cross. Such a perception corresponds to the Christian notions of the cross as an all bearing tree (Petrosyan, H. 2008). The trimmings of palm décor join the two little crosses.</ImportantFeatures>
