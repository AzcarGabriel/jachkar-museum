        The cross is carved in a niche, and the two wings have two triple- loops. The middle loops are stretched and have a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. The palm decors originates from the cross and transforms into snakes that symbolize the defense of the garden-paradise (paradise-tree). The right and the left parts of the khachkars represent various geometric and vegetative ornaments. There are probably pomegranate leaves originating from the niche. Those stimulate the Christian allegory of fruits: under the sour rind, there are sweet seeds (Petrosyan, H.2008).The cornice represents interlaced geometric ornaments.
