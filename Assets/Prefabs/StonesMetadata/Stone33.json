  "importantFeatures": "The cross is carved in a niche, and the two wings have two triple- loops. The middle loop is stretched and has a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. The two little crosses on the right and the left parts of the central cross, symbolize the two bandits crucified with the Christ.  The niche represents the ritualistic character of the cross to the believer (e.g. worshiping) and symbolizes the terrestrial sphere, and the abstract-universal measure of the cross (Petrosyan, H. 2008).Two pomegranates that originate from the upper part of the cross stimulate the Christian allegory of fruits: under the sour rind, there are sweet seeds (Petrosyan, H.2008).The cornice of the khachkar is partially broken and there is a little cross carved on the right part. The right and the left parts of the cross represent various interlaced geometrical and vegetative ornaments. There are probably three little crosses carved under the main cross and their wings are capped with double buttons (typical to the 9-10th century khachkars)",
