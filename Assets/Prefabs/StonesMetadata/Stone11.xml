      <ImportantFeatures>The main cross is has two wings with two triple-loops. The middle loops are stretched and have a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. Two pomegranates that originate from the upper part of the cross stimulate the Christian allegory of fruits: under the sour rind, there are sweet seeds (Petrosyan, H.2008). The palm decor is depicted as originating from the cross. Such a perception corresponds to the Christian notions of the cross as an all bearing tree (Petrosyan, H. 2008). The trimmings of the palm décor transform into birds that link to the palm tree as the tree of life. The cornice and the right and the left parts of khachkar represent interlaced geometric ornaments</ImportantFeatures>
