      <ImportantFeatures>The cross is carved in a niche, and the two wings have two triple- loops. The middle loop is stretched and has a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. The niche represents the ritualistic character of the cross to the believer (e.g. worshiping) and symbolizes the terrestrial sphere, and the abstract-universal measure of the cross (Petrosyan, H. 2008). The two little crosses on the right and the left parts of the central cross, symbolize the two bandits crucified with the Christ. There are two encircled two little flowers at the top of the two wings of the main cross. The palm decor is depicted as originating from the cross. Such a perception corresponds to the Christian notions of the cross as an all bearing tree (Petrosyan, H. 2008). The trimmings of the palm décor join the two little crosses. The cornice of the khachkar and the right and the left parts represent various geometrical and vegetative ornaments</ImportantFeatures>
