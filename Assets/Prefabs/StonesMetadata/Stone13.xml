      <ImportantFeatures>Khachkar represents two crosses. The two wings of each khachkar have two triple-loops. The middle loops are stretched and have a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the crosses. The right and the left parts of the khachkar represent various geometric and vegetative ornaments. Khachkar has a beautiful rosette that has a form of a chamomile with 12 petals that symbolize 12 apostles. The cornice represents interlaced geometric ornaments. Palm decors originate from the crosses and such a perception corresponds to the Christian notions of the crosses as all bearing trees (Petrosyan, H. 2008)</ImportantFeatures>
