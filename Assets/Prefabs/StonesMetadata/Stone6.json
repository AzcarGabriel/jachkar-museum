  "importantFeatures": "The cross is carved in a niche, and the two wings have two triple- loops. The middle loop is stretched and has a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. Two pomegranates, carved beneath the two wings stimulate the Christian allegory of fruits: under the sour rind, there are sweet seeds (Petrosyan, H.2008). Rosette has various vegetative ornaments (mainly palm leaves) and is crowned with a thin ribbon-like border - resembling a shield or a tray. The main cross is surrounded by rich vegetative decorations such as the grape and leaves of grape. In this khachkar, the palm decors appear on the right and left sides, from the bottom to the foursquare with swastikas and other ornaments. The cornice represents a pattern of intertwined elements",
