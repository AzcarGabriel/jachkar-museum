      <ImportantFeatures>The cross is carved in a niche, and the two wings have two triple- loops. The middle loops are stretched and have a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. The palm decor originates from the cross and such a perception corresponds to the Christian notions of the cross as an all bearing tree (Petrosyan, H. 2008). It transforms into snakes that symbolize the defense of the garden-paradise (paradise-tree). And the edges of palm décor transform into birds that link to the palm tree as the tree of life. The right and the left parts of the khachkars represent various interlaced geometric and vegetative ornaments. The cornice has a domelike appearance and represents interlaced geometric ornaments</ImportantFeatures>
