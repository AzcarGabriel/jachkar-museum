      <ImportantFeatures>The cross is carved in a niche, and the two wings have two triple-loops. The middle loop is stretched and has a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the cross. Two pomegranates that originate from the upper part of the cross stimulate the Christian allegory of fruits: under the sour rind, there are sweet seeds (Petrosyan, H.2008). The palm décor is depicted as originating from the cross and such a perception corresponds to the Christian notions of the cross as an all bearing tree (Petrosyan, H. 2008). The cornice of the khachkar and the right and the left parts represent various geometrical and vegetative ornaments. There is a cross originating from the palm decor which probably has a form of the tree of life</ImportantFeatures>
